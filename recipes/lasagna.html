        <h4>Method</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat the oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring, for 5
                minutes or until
                onion softens. Add the mince and cook, stirring with a wooden spoon to break up any lumps, for 5 minutes
                or
                until mince
                changes colour. Add the tomato, wine and tomato paste, and bring to the boil. Reduce heat to low.
                Simmer,
                uncovered,
                stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes or until sauce thickens slightly. Remove from heat. Taste and
                season
                with salt and
                pepper.
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, to make the cheese sauce, combine the milk, onion, parsley stalks, peppercorns, cloves and
                bay
                leaves in a
                medium saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Remove from heat and set aside for 15 minutes to
                infuse.
            </li>
            <li>
                Strain the milk mixture through a fine sieve into a large jug. Discard solids.
            </li>
            <li>
                Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium-high heat until foaming. Add the flour and cook,
                stirring,
                for 1-2
                minutes or until mixture bubbles and begins to come away from the side of the pan. Remove from heat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Gradually pour in half the milk, whisking constantly with a balloon whisk, until mixture is smooth.
                Gradually add the
                remaining milk, whisking until smooth and combined.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to the boil, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, for
                5
                minutes or
                until sauce thickens and coats the back of the spoon. Remove from heat. Add the parmesan and stir until
                cheese melts.
                Taste and season with nutmeg, salt and white pepper.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 180Â°C. Brush a rectangular 3L (12 cup) capacity ovenproof dish with oil to lightly
                grease.
                Spread
                one-quarter of the bechamel sauce over the base of the prepared dish. Arrange 1 lasagne sheet over the
                sauce. Top with
                one-third of the mince mixture and one-third of the remaining bechamel sauce. Continue layering with the
                remaining
                lasagne sheets, mince mixture and bechamel, finishing with a layer of bechamel. Sprinkle with
                mozzarella.
                Place on a
                baking tray. Bake in preheated oven for 40 minutes or until cheese melts, is golden brown, and the edges
                are
                bubbling.
                Remove from oven and set aside for 10 minutes to set.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cut the lasagne into 8 portions and serve with mixed salad leaves.
